🚀 Building Scalable & Efficient Test Automation – My Selenium Python Hybrid Framework! 🚀  

As a QA Automation Engineer, I’m always looking for ways to enhance test automation with efficiency, maintainability, and scalability. That’s why I built a Selenium Python Hybrid Framework that integrates modern testing best practices and DevOps automation.  

🔹 Key Features & Tech Stack: 
✅ Pytest for test execution– Enables parallel execution, fixtures, and robust assertion handling.  
✅ Page Object Model (POM) – Improves maintainability and reduces redundancy in test scripts.  
✅ Data-Driven Testing with JSON – Easy test data management for dynamic test cases.  
✅ Jenkins & GitHub CI/CD Integration – Automates test execution and reporting for continuous testing.  
✅ pytest-html Reporting – Generates detailed, interactive reports for better test insights.  
✅ Conftest File for Browser Driver – Centralized browser setup for efficient test execution.  
✅ Utils File with Reusable Methods – Streamlines test actions and improves code reusability.  

🔹 Why This Framework?
This framework is designed to:  
✔️ Improve test execution speed and efficiency.  
✔️ Ensure better test script organization and reusability.  
✔️ Seamlessly integrate with DevOps for continuous testing.  
✔️ Provide insightful reports to debug failures faster.  


I’d love to hear your thoughts and feedback! Let’s collaborate and make test automation more efficient. 🚀
